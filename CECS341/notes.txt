Address Modes:
1. For data manipulation: register direct
2. For data transfer: base register 
3. Branch type

ADD 
LD R1, M1
LD R2, M2
ADD R3, R2, R1
ST M3, R3

How do we design the Data Path?
- We design for one instruction type at a time.

R-type instructions:
- Add, or, and, sub, pass B, nor
- repeating operands from register
- 32 registers, how many bits are we using? 5 bits 
D-type instructions:
- 2 types: load and store
- dealing with memory
- indirect 

Register ID # has to be consistent. 
Can only use one register # for one location
Need for separate register files? No
