& is an address
* is in front of variable name 
char * cptr;
int * ptr;
int y = sizeof(ptr);

can declare pointer by itself
cant declare a reference by itself

ptr = &x; points to x
ptr = &y; points to y

char c1 = 'z'; 

cptr = &c1;//points to 'z' 

cout << c1; //'z' prints out
cout << *cptr;//'z' prints out 
c1 = '?';

*cptr = '5';
